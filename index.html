    <h1>🥐 Croissant</h1>
    <p>A croissant is a French pastry made from puff pastry in a crescent shape.

        It is a buttery, flaky, viennoiserie pastry inspired by the shape of the Austrian kipferl but using the French
        yeast-leavened laminated dough.Croissants are named for their historical crescent shape. Crescent-shaped breads
        have been made since the Renaissance, and crescent-shaped cakes possibly since antiquity.
        Croissants are a common part of a continental breakfast in many European countries and served as dessert all
        around the world.</p>
